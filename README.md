# Instagramp-2
In our Agile class, we were given the creative freedom to develop an application connected to a database, showcasing the complete set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 

## Purpose
This project was designed to provide us with hands-on experience in the software development life cycle, allowing us to apply our knowledge within a controlled and educational environment.
